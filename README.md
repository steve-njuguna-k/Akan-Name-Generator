Akan-Name-Generator
-------------------
Akan Name Generator is a web application that takes your birthday and calculates the day of the week you were born and then depending on their gender gives you an Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
